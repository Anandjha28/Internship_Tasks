# Task 1 - Random Password Generator

## Description:
This C++ program generates a secure random password based on user-defined criteria like:
- Password length
- Use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters

## Features:
- User input for customization
- Random character generation
- Ensures strong password security

## How to run:
1. Compile with any C++ compiler
2. Run and follow input prompts

# Task 2 - Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in C++. The user plays against the computer, which makes random choices. The game continues until the user chooses to quit.

## Features

- User vs Computer gameplay
- Random computer choices using C++ rand() function
- Rule-based winner selection
- Loop continues until user quits

## How to Run

1. *Clone or Download the Code*

   Save the .cpp file in your local system, e.g., rps_game.cpp

2. *Compile the Code*

   Use any C++ compiler, e.g., g++:

   ```bash
   g++ rps_game.cpp -o rps_game
# ðŸ”¢ Basic Calculator in C++

This is a simple console-based calculator built using C++ as part of my internship task. It performs basic arithmetic operations like:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (âˆ’)
- Multiplication (Ã—)
- Division (Ã·)

## ðŸ›  Features

- Takes input from the user
- Handles four basic operators
- Displays result using switch-case
- Handles division by zero error

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- IDE: Any C++ Compiler (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, OnlineGDB)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Conditional statements (if, switch-case)
- Basic user input/output handling in C++
- Error handling (division by zero)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Copy the code into a `.cpp` file.
2. Compile and run using a C++ compiler.
3. Follow the prompts to enter operator and two numbers.

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshot (Optional)

_Add a screenshot here of the program running in console._

# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game in C++

A fun console game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. The program gives hints whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Random number generation using `rand()` and `srand()`
- Takes repeated input from the user
- Uses a loop until correct guess is made
- Simple and beginner-friendly

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- IDE: Any C++ Compiler (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, OnlineGDB)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Use of loops (while loop)
- Random number generation (`rand() % 100 + 1`)
- Logical comparison and conditional branching

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Copy the code into a `.cpp` file.
2. Compile and run using a C++ compiler.
3. Try guessing the number between 1 and 100.

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshot (Optional)

_Add a screenshot here of the game running._
